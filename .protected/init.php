/* 
 * ABOUT:
 * The system is designed with portability in mind, and the
 * website can reside in any subdirectory (hence the symbolic
 * links in the root bridging the public directory).
 * I recommended configuring the host so the document root is
 * set to the public directory, this is a good security
 * practice.
 *
 * The system routes requests to scripts based on the
 * [request => script] mapping done in route.php
 *
 * Author ~ Jonas Nielsen

 *
 * PRELOADED CONSTANTS:
 * * DIR (.protected directory root)
 * * WEBSITE_URL (URL to the website)
 * * WEBSITE_REQUEST (URL path trailing the website URL)
 *
 * SUPERGLOBAL CONTAINING DATA PASSED IN DYNAMIC REQUESTS:
 * * $_REQUEST
 *
 * SCRIPT FUNCTIONS:
 * * scr_is() (returns true if passed script is the requested script)
 * * scr_url() (returns url of passed script as mapped in route.php)
